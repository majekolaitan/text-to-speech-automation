The church of the Old Testament accepted the law of God as its rule of life. The Ten- Commandment law is unchangeable because it is an expression of God's character, which is universal, eternal, unchangeable. Long before the commandments were given to Moses on Mount Sinai the people of God were keeping them. God said, "Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws " (Genesis 26:5).

God has had only one method of salvation, one standard of righteousness, all through the ages. We read in Psalm 105:8-11 that He made a covenant with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and the children of Israel "for an everlasting covenant." God declares that the covenant was made forever, "the word which He commanded to a thousand generations." It is not correct to say that in the Old Testament times people were under law and in New Testament times people were under grace. God has always maintained a harmony of law and grace. We are saved by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and when we have experienced this salvation and have entered into a saving relationship with Him, we delight to do His will.

The members of the Old Testament church showed their faith in the plan of salvation by offering a sacrifice. By faith they accepted God's plan, for the sacrifice was a symbol of the Lamb of God, who would take away the sins of the world. They became free men and women, new creatures through faith in the coming Messiah. The hope of the ages has always been the coming of the Lord.

God instructed the church members in Old Testament times through prophets. Moses was the first writer whom God used to record permanent instructions for His church and to preserve the people's experiences for future generations. These inspired writings were read to the congregations on the seventh-day Sabbath and on other special occasions. These writings are known to us as the Old Testament.
